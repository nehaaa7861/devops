Docker Layer Caching

Docker is a powerful platform that allows developers to create, package, and distribute applications as containers. One of the key benefits of using Docker is the ability to use layer caching, which can dramatically speed up the development process and reduce the time it takes to build and deploy applications. In this blog post, we will take a deep dive into Docker layer caching and explore how it works.

Introduction to Docker Layer Caching:
Before we dive into the details of Docker layer caching, let’s first define what we mean by a layer. A Docker image is made up of multiple layers, where each layer represents a change to the file system. Each layer is immutable and can be reused across multiple images. For example, if you have two Docker images that share a common base image, they will both use the same base layer.

Docker layer caching is the process of reusing layers that have already been built and cached locally, rather than rebuilding them from scratch. This can significantly speed up the Docker build process, as the Docker engine only needs to rebuild the layers that have changed since the last build. Layer caching can also reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred when images are pushed and pulled from Docker registries.

-> How Docker Layer Caching Works:

Docker uses a layered file system to store the contents of a Docker image. Each layer contains a set of changes to the file system, such as adding or modifying files. When a Docker image is built, each layer is built individually, and the resulting layers are stacked on top of one another to create the final image.

When Docker builds an image, it checks whether each layer has already been built before. If a layer has already been built, Docker will use the cached version of that layer instead of rebuilding it. This can significantly speed up the build process, since Docker only needs to build layers that have changed since the last build.

Here’s an example of how this works in practice. Let’s say we have a Dockerfile that looks like this:

FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD [“npm”, “start”]
When we build this Dockerfile for the first time, Docker will build each layer individually. The FROM instruction will be used to build the first layer, which contains the Node.js runtime environment. The WORKDIR, COPY, RUN, and CMD instructions will each be used to build subsequent layers.

If we make a change to our application code, and then rebuild the Docker image, Docker will check each layer to see if it has already been built before. Since the Node.js runtime environment layer hasn’t changed, Docker will use the cached version of that layer. This means that Docker only needs to build the layers that have changed since the last build, which can save a significant amount of time.

-> Layer Caching Strategies:

Docker provides several strategies for caching layers, which can be specified in the Docker file. The most common strategies are:

--no-cache: This strategy tells the Docker engine to ignore the cache and rebuild all layers from scratch. This can be useful when you need to ensure that all dependencies are up to date.
--cache-from: This strategy tells the Docker engine to use a specific image as the cache source. This can be useful when you want to reuse layers from a previous build or a different image.
--build-arg: This strategy allows you to pass build-time variables to the Docker file. You can use build-time variables to control the caching behavior of specific commands in the Docker file.
--pull: This strategy tells the Docker engine to always pull the latest version of the base image from the registry, even if a local copy exists. This can be useful when you need to ensure that you are using the latest version of the base image.
-> Best Practices for Docker Layer Caching:

To get the most out of Docker layer caching, it is important to follow these best practices:

Keep your Docker file small and focused. Each command in the Docker file creates a new layer, so try to minimize the number of commands.
Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of your final image. Multi-stage builds allow you to create a temporary image with all of the build dependencies, and then copy only the necessary files into the final image.
Reorder your Docker file commands to take advantage of layer caching.
